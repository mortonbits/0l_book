> ### Command Line Notation
>
> In this chapter and throughout the book, we’ll show some commands used in the
> terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with `$`. You
> don’t need to type in the `$` character; it indicates the start of each
> command. Lines that don’t start with `$` typically show the output of the
> previous command. Additionally, PowerShell-specific examples will use `>`
> rather than `$`.
